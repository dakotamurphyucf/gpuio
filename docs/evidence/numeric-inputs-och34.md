# Numeric and OTP component evidence (OCH-34)

## Current scope

OCH-34 is In Progress. Shared numeric domain/draft rules are implemented; native
sliders, numeric input/stepper and OTP integration remain pending. No OCH-34
capability is advertised and no new native GUI acceptance is claimed.

The [design and pinned-source review](../design/numeric-inputs.md) records the
candidate single/range support and bridge gaps. Public contracts were drafted in
`lib/core/numeric.mli` before implementation. No dependency or toolchain pin changed.

## Shared numeric foundation, local macOS arm64

`Numeric.Domain` validates finite bounds, a positive resolvable step and bounded
step count; supports fixed intervals and steps larger than the span; anchors the
grid at minimum and includes an irregular maximum endpoint. Normalization and
adjacent stepping are bounded operations. `Numeric.Draft` separates empty,
incomplete, malformed/nonfinite/oversized, in-range and out-of-range text without
owning or modifying an editor.

OCaml expect tests and Rust tests cover min anchoring, irregular endpoints, exact
binary ties, repeated stepping/saturation, nonfinite inputs and invalid domain
imports. Each implementation checks 7,175 samples across seven domains for bound
preservation, normalization idempotence, strict progress and inverse adjacency,
including large offsets, tiny/large magnitudes and a trillion grid intervals.
Draft tests include `-`, `.`, `1e-`, trailing decimal points, exponents, outside
bounds, overflow, invalid separators/hex/non-ASCII digits and oversized input.

An independent 24-byte little-endian fixture for min=-1.5, max=2.25, step=0.125
matches OCaml bin_prot and Rust binprot. The Rust standalone decoder rejects
truncation, trailing/oversized input and invalid/nonfinite domain fields. OCaml
validates wire imports through the public abstract domain boundary.

Cross-language testing found that Rust's `is_ascii_whitespace` excludes vertical
tab, unlike the intended six-character ASCII whitespace grammar. Both parsers
now explicitly enumerate space, tab, LF, CR, VT and FF. The regression passes.
The only OCaml expectation adjustment was reviewed UTF-8 sexp escaping for the
invalid full-width-digit input; no behavior assertion was auto-promoted.

Commands (isolated checkout, `GPUIO_JOBS=2`) all pass:

```sh
./scripts/gpuio exec dune build -j 2 @test/view_api/runtest @fmt
./scripts/gpuio exec cargo test --locked -j 2 -p gpuio-protocol
./scripts/gpuio exec cargo clippy --locked -j 2 -p gpuio-protocol --all-targets -- -D warnings
./scripts/gpuio exec cargo fmt --all
```

This is pure Core/protocol validation, not native interaction evidence. Next:
explicit native single/range-slider ownership, revisioned commands/snapshots,
input cancellation/coalescing and independent keyboard/AX thumbs, followed by
the numeric editor/stepper and OTP acceptance in the live ticket. Consolidated
hosted macOS/Linux gates and merge remain pending.
